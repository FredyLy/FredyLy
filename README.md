# Hi there 👋
### I'm Fredy, student at the Wild Code School Paris campus.
### Nice to meet you 🤝
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<p>I use to work in Project Management, but I've decided to become a Web Developer! (Yeay! 🙌)</p>
<p>🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript on React and Node libraries.</p>
<p>You can find on my GitHub some of my projects, or you can have a look at my <strong>portfolio</strong> too: https://fredyly.github.io/portfolio/.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>By the way, I am currently looking for a 12-month work-study contract (from September 2021), so I am open to all opportunities.</p>
