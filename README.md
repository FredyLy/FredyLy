### Hi there 👋
<p>I'm Fredy, student at the Wild Code School Paris campus. </p>
<p>Nice to meet you 🤝</p>
<br />
<hr />
<br />
<p>I used to work in Project Management, but I've decided to become a Web Developer! (Yeay! 🙌)</p>
<p>🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript on React and Node libraries.</p>
<p>Here are some of my projects.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>By the way, I am currently looking for a 4 to 6-month internship (from March 2021), so I am open to all opportunities.</p>
